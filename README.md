Ok we actually need this.
If you want to be caught up, download these assets

The way to use the Adam's character pack AI is to download it to a new project and export a package (in the assets folder) with only the assets of Adam (not Guard or Lu) 

Also get Rain AI because it has a lot of what we need

As it stands, the things that still need to be done are the AI (Rain AI will help a ton with this so download it), the detection (my job), A star path finding (Alex just needs to test so just see if you can set it up with these assets), the UI (including mini map, points), the cutscene post game, and something else probably. 


Spook.
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
